Hello everyone, while looking for what to print in 3D, I had an idea for a mechanical piggy bank, I first made it in Lego for the prototype in order to make a few adjustments, and as I find it nice I post it here. In the printed version it will have a motor and a switch to make it automatic :D

Greetings to all of you.
